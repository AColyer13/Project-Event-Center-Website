INDEX: OK I'm going to start off first with the index and the index has a body that has the navigation links with the hero content image and a link to the events page.

EVENTS: Within the events page I have a navigation bar again at the top and within there I have a header a main and a footer the main section includes the upcoming events with an article class. These include the soccer tournaments as well as the soccer games and music at the field.

LOCATION: The menu is set up using Table class and I used the CSS file which took a while to get the formatting correct and so it shows right on pages.

CONTACT US: The contact us page has three forms and I ensured that all are required to send in the form and that the e-mail has the at symbol within the form.
